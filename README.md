## 🚨 Working Coursera Solver 2026: Why 99% of Extensions are Broken

The digital landscape is currently filled with abandoned, broken browser extensions from 2023 and 2024. Because modern e-learning platforms frequently update their front-end Document Object Model (DOM) structure, legacy scripts inevitably break. Furthermore, the vast majority of existing tools employ a freemium model that gates quiz automation behind a paywall.

This repository, **Coursera Quiz AI Solver 2026**, represents a complete architectural rewrite. We have explicitly engineered a robust **Coursera DOM injection auto clicker** and parser that successfully navigates modern Single Page Application (SPA) lifecycles and hidden React `data-testid` hooks. This allows you to effortlessly auto-answer quizzes, bypass lengthy manual entry, and complete modular assessments with zero friction.

## 💡 Free Coursera Solver No API Key: Bypassing OpenAI Subscription Costs

One of the largest barriers to entry for modern educational AI tools is "subscription fatigue." The standard architecture of a Coursera auto submit script requires the user to input a personal OpenAI or Gemini API key, shifting the computational cost directly onto the user. 

We completely bypassed this artificially costly gateway. This extension actively bridges communication with an **already open ChatGPT web tab**. By seamlessly hooking into the live session and programmatically formatting prompts directly into the input area, it acts as a fully automated Coursera multiple choice AI bot—without ever touching a paid API endpoint or exhausting your personal API budget.

## 🛠️ Core Features & Capabilities

* **Automated Coursera DOM Injection:** Instantly binds to complex React interfaces. Effortlessly discovers deeply nested `<span class="cds-button-label">` elements and `data-testid` markers to auto-start and auto-resume assignments.
* **Invisible Bridge Architecture:** Extracts questions, potential answers, and context from the quiz page and injects them seamlessly into your active ChatGPT tab.
* **Brace-Balancing JSON Extraction:** Ensures deterministic extraction of complex ChatGPT outputs (including code questions, True/False logic, and deep analytical reasoning matrices).
* **Auto Submit Script 2026:** Automatically clicks standard DOM checkboxes, bypasses the "Honor Code" React validations via synthetic mouse events, checks answers, and commits the graded submission block flawlessly.
